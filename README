Project codename Nimbus

Nimbus is intended to be a personal cloud and integrate every part of your digital life into one place while allowing you to share it all with friends. Some pieces of Nimbus will be paid for, some will be a monthly fee, and others may be free or have a free trial.

Nimbus will technically be a platform that connects to modules that allow the user to do certain things (see "modules.txt" for a preliminary list.) The modules can be purchased separately.


Directories:
/uml - Contains UML diagrams that outline the project. These files were created with ArogUML (http://argouml.tigris.org/). ArgoUML is a visual UML design tool -- if you'd like to look at the UML diagrams, please use said program.

/ideas - Contains the textual ideas of this project. This directory will be archived or removed at a later date, and is probably very hard to follow because it is just the ramblings inside my head.

/src - Contains the source code for Project Nimbus. Subdirectories are below.
	/src/modules - Contains the source files for modules.
	/src/platform - Contains the source files for the platform. The platform is basically a liaison between the modules and the users.
		/src/platform/x - Contains the platform files for the named OS.
	
Road-map:
v0.0.1.0 - Working platform with 1+ working modules on any platform (I'm looking at a Windows platform with 2 working modules.)
V0.1.0.0 - Fully implemented platform (excluding mobile devices and web) with at least 5 fully functional modules.
v1.0.0.0 - Fully implemented platform including all mobile platforms and a web platform with at least 15 fully functional modules
